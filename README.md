## Problem Statement

In many polling booths across India, manual voter verification leads to long queues and delays, causing voter frustration and potential security risks. The traditional process is time-consuming and prone to human error, impacting overall efficiency on polling day.

## Solution Overview

VoteVerify 2025 digitizes the voter verification process by:
- **Automating Identity Verification:** Using digital scanning of voter IDs and (conceptually) integrating biometric/QR code-based checks (with Vertex AI for facial recognition).
- **Real-Time Queue Management:** Displaying live queue status and estimated waiting times to reduce congestion.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Allowing booth administrators to monitor the verification process and operational metrics in real time.
- **Operational Analytics:** Providing a dynamic view of voter turnout and system performance during pollingâ€”while final official results are released later by the Election Commission.
